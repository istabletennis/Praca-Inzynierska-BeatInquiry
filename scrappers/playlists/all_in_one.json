(Who else)\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together\n\n\nI can't sleep at night when you are on my mind\nBobby Womack's on the radio\nSingin' to me, \"If you think you're lonely now\"\nWait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)\nI gotta change the station\nSo I turn the dial, tryna catch a break\nAnd then I hear Babyface, \"I only think of you\"\nAnd it's breakin' my heart\nI'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart\n\n\nI'm feelin' all out of my element\nThrowin' things, cryin'\nTryna figure out where the hell I went wrong\nThe pain reflected in this song\nAin't even half of what I'm feelin' inside\nI need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)\n(We belong together)\n\n\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Together)\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?

Who would'a even thought possibly\nCupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?\nIt's true that I got shot in the heart\nBut when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are\nBut see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see\n'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach\nUp under the seat as your heart starts to beat\nBefore you make a decision that's life-altering\nAnd just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave\nYou hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring\n\n\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, \u2018cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)\n\n\nHa, ha, yeah right, bitch\nSpend some time on my dick\n\n\nIn most cases, Stat's attitude is, \"Fuck a bitch!\"\nMy only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch\nBut you was different, thought we shared a covenant\nEven held your hand in pub-a-lic\nWe sufferin' because of this\nShawty on some whole 'nother other shit\nTryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip\nI'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit\nFeedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss\nWe started off closer than close\nBut who could've predicted to know\nYour trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?\nAnd the final result, back in that same boat\nI asked myself: \"Do I love these hoes?\" \u2014 Nope!\n\n\n(Yeah) Em introduced us: \"50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50\"\nThen slid off and left her to kick it with me\nI complimented her, I said, \"You have very nice lips.\"\nWith my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick\nWe played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast\nHad her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass\nDowntown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline\nPenthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind\nShe got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too\nWhy talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?\nSaid she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice\nYeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)\n\n\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, \u2018cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"

New chick I never met\nWas friends with girls, but I hadn't really been attracted to nobody yet\nBut eighth grade, was going crazy, this bitch was so amazing\nWalked up and said, \"Hi, I'm Dave,\" and then shit changed (Love)\nShe told m\u0435 she just moved into town\nI knew it, no doubt, I lov\u0435d this girl inside and out\nHer beautiful smile, her hair and her style were drivin' me wild\nWe sat together on the bus, we sat together every lunch\nShe had me switching up the polos and ditchin' yo-yo's\nI went from moving solo-dolo to being so\nO-B-S-E-double-S-E-D\nThought about her constantly, on Kazaa burning her CDs\n'Cause I saw her and she saw me (Aw)\nBut back then, I was gross (Ugh)\nI'd do the most for a joke (Ah)\nI'd show my asshole to girls (Man)\nAnd I just really wasn't the brand of guy that would get the girls\nI had no facial hair, just curls\nAnd all my friends had kissed a girl except me\nAnd I just wanted to be realistic about it\nI didn't want to mess the whole thing up (No)\nAnd I just loved being around her\nSo I took the best friend route (Oh)\nThat shit was so fun, I don't care what any of you guys say\nThe hottest girl I ever met tickling my arm, going to the mall with her, chatting on AOL all night\nWe talked about plenty things, everything we could\nHow he parents treated her and how she felt misunderstood\nShe would tell me shit on AIM in person that she never could\nI talked her through it\nI took a ton of pride up in the fact that I made her feel good (Yeah)\nStarted hanging out up in the basements\nPlayin' \"Spin the Bottle,\" watchin' her turn land on Jason\nI closed my eyes until we played the nervous game\nWhere I would place my hand up on her breast over her bra\nThat was incredible, that was raw, I jerked off to that all fall\nWinter snow days watching the television like, \"Come on\"\nSeeing what the hell they call, hit the landline and I call\nHope she picks up, not her mom\nBut you'll never know what's coming\nWhen you're young and you're in love\nHigh school next year, this a problem\nSophmores, juniors, seniors, everybody saw her\nI remember browsing Blockbuster with her\nWhen this senior cocksucker told her she looked beautiful\nShe blushed, he was popular, I just stood to the side and waited\nObviously, they started dating\nHarrison Ave. just wasn't the same without her\nThe bus stop, he drove her to school\nIn a car with rims and real big bass\nHated this guy, I hated their vibe, I hated his face\nI waited for their demise, but it never seemed to happen\nShe was too attached and he latched on\nNow she leavin' my friend group\nSmokin', drinkin' with them dudes\nOh no, we are not ready for that\nWe got pizza by the slice, big ol' shoutout to Frank's\nThat's where I was when I found out that they were having sex (Fuck)\nI hit the beach just to meet her, but they already left\nAnd her presence was missed, but she still my best friend\nMozzarella sticks, I never sat with her at lunch\nI strategize my hallway walk so I could see her some\nThe only class we had together, Spanish, what the fuck?\nI was Carlos, she was Mia\nWhy did they make us choose Spanish names, by the way?\nIsn't that insane? (Yes) I digress (Uh)\nOf course he cheated on her, she would call me so depressed\nBut she kept goin' back, mapquestin', printin' out directions\nI designated drive to his parties, that shit was so\u2014\nI was soft, I was pussy, I was weak, I was lame\nBut whatever, I'm in ninth grade, what the hell could I say? (Uh)\nBut one time I stayed home, his party got busted by the po-po\nIt made me so, so, so, so, so, so happy\nHe got grounded and the dance was this week (Ha)\nI never went to those, but now she could just stay home with me (Hey)\nWhy didn't I go to them?\nOkay, 'cause I was scared of getting boners on the dance floor\nThe whole thing was overwhelming, it was just a bizarre social situation\nI didn't drink, everyone did, whatever, back to the story (Uh)\nI was excited to just chill with her, return to our glory\nThen she like, \"Dave, wait, we should go to the dance together\" (Huh?)\n\"Just be my date\"\nI'm like, \"What?\" She like, \"Yeah,\" I'm like, \"Uh\"\nI came and came, my brain just said yes (Ya)\nPopularity-wise, this is a jetpack and I miss my friend\nAnd obviously I was fully in love with her, so I said, \"Okay, no problem\"\nI got my suit with my mama\nThen we all met up at a fella's house to take a few pics\nSixteen girls, sixteen guys, parents filming this shit (Ooh)\nI pull up with my mama, oh my God, there's a problem\nThe fucking guy isn't grounded, he's really there with his arm around her\nI couldn't believe it, she said that he showed up and surprised her\nAnd then of course somebody's like, \"We gotta take a wide pic\" (Everyone)\nThirty-three people, only one had no date\nMy mama asking me why, but I felt way too ashamed\nSo I just lied, I told her that I knew this was happening\nAnd that everything was good, and I could not abandon that\nSo I went with them, in the limo, in the dinner\nMacaroni Grill, I'm the thirty-third wheel, is this is real?\nBut it got worse, right before the bill\nA bunch of waiters and waitresses bringing cake to my table\nThey're all singing happy birthday to me\n(What) Happy birthday to me\nNot my birthday and of course this fucking restaurant has this custom\nWhere you gotta stand up on the table\nAnd wave a fucking napkin while everyone stares\nI saw the older guys laugh, so I just played into it\nI'm on the table dancing, embarrassed, but no one knew it\nExcept Britney did and she had been drinking, shit\nThe water bottle full of liquor lower than my confidence\nI said I had to piss, hoping that she would just follow me\nShe did, and I walked right past the bathroom into the parking lot\nWhere I told her, I told her everything on my mind, I told her everything\nEvery single song that made me think about her every day\nEverybody said that we're just kids, but that never changed\nThe fact that to this kid, you were his everything\nThe next part, I will never forget\nShe walked right up to me slowly, then she gave me a kiss (Uh)\nFirst kiss, ah, no way, no, oh my God (Woah)\nThen she said, \"I love you too\"\nI didn't believe her at first, I thought she was drunk (Oh my god)\nBut then the next day she was singing the same song? (Woo)\nShe ran over to my crib and was all over me\nWe started kissing, touching, blushing, gushing\nThere was no humping yet, not then, but I would settle for love\nGot my first handjob in a park, really came out the mud (Uh)\nI couldn't believe, it was a dream\nI planted my seed on Harrison Avenue yet again\nI really did it, huh? (Yeah)\nAnd then all of a sudden, it was done\nJust a month long and then she moved on\nI never knew someone could make you feel so right and so wrong\nSo good and so bad, either way, I had what I had\nAnd to show me I was who I was, and that I was worthy of love\n\n\nI love you, but you know, oh\nI love you, girl\nI love you, but you know, oh (It's the evolution of man)\nI love you, girl\nI love you, but you know, oh (I'm still evolving)\nI love you, girl\nI love you, but you know, oh (Yes, I do)"

        "lyrics": "\nShe was on her way to becomin' a college graduate\nWouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid\nThe type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with\nFuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire\nDisciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire\nFlyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez\nEveryone told me, kickin' it to her was hopeless\nAt first I just thought she didn't mess with broke kids\nThe thug niggas always talkin' about how they smoke kids\nBut the rich sniff-coke kids got no play\n\"I'm not even interested\" is what her body language would say\nEveryone around the way gave up tryin' to get in it\nIt didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it\nOn the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn't admit it\nTalk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it\nCause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it\nAnd no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick\nSmokin' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it\nShe spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin' to copy\nBut when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy\nShe had a style, all her own, respectful and pure\nI was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure\n\n\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n\nHer eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad\nI used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad\nThat I wasn't just another nigga tryin' to get in it\nSo every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute\nI didn't have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours\nOn her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers\nThen I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower\nWe talked about power to the people and such\nWe spent more time together, but it was never enough\nI never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel\nI was too interested in keepin' it real\nPerfectly honest and complete\nShe would always call me \"cari\u00f1o\" and never Technique\nBought me a new book to read every two or three weeks\nForever changin' the expression of my thoughts when I speak\nIt was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks\nShe convinced me to stop hangin' out on the streets\nTo stop robbin' and stealin' from people like you\nInstead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo\nMuseo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too\nGot to the point when I was either with her or my crew\nSo I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true\nI couldn't live without her, so I told her, facin' my fears\nBut honey's only response was a face full of tears\nShe could only sob hysterically, holdin' me tight\nI tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight\nI felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light\nExcept I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night\n\n\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n\nI went on with my life, college and my career\nEnded up locked up like an animal for a year\nWhere the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer\nThen I got sent to the hole when my exit was near\nAt night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her\nHold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared\nJust an empty cell until the state gave me parole\nIn the summer, came back, intact and on track\nBut the fact of the matter is I still felt cold\nEven after my mother hugged me, cryin' at home\nMy real niggas would catch me thinkin', outta my zone\nFuckin' lots of different women, but I still felt alone\nRelatively well-known around the New York underground\nBut I kept thinkin' of her and how we used to be down\nThe sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair\nThough gone physically, somehow it was still there\nI had to do somethin' because the shit was too much to bear\nSo I went and visited the building where she used to live\nThe world looks a lot different after you do a bid\nThe way your life done changed\nWhile primitive minds are still stuck in the same game\nLike her cousin who was on the corner, slangin' cocaine\nStepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name\nHer mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta\nBut her facial expression changed\nWhen I asked about her daughter\n\n\nDon't you know that time waits for no man?\nMy fate, it's all planned\nI'm blessed just to know you\nI've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night\nCan't find a reason why\nGod came between you and I\nAnd if I had the chance again, I'd never let you go\nHold tight to your love, \u2018cause you never know\n\n\nShe told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind\nAnd she had left it there waitin' for such a long time\nI was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first\nI saw a tear swellin' up in her eye, and then she cursed\nShe told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin' the worst\nReversed my position, stepped over and opened the door\nAnd sure enough there was an envelope\nWith my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cari\u00f1o,\" is what the letter said\n\"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead\nBut when you left in '97, a part of me went to Heaven\nI thank God at least I got to know what love really was\nBut it hurt me to see what true love really does\n\u2018Cause even though we never made love\nYou were all that there was\nIt was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave\nYou made me doubt the way I thought\nYou made me want to believe\nAnd then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me\nIt was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me\nThis was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be\nBaby, don't you see?\nI had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV\nHope didn't exist for me since late in 1993\nI died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you\nI cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you\nPromise that you'll meet me in Paradise inevitably\nNo matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me.\"\nWhat happened for the rest of the day is still a blur\nBut I remember wishin' that I was dead, instead of her\nShe was buried on August 3rd\nThe story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don't fuckin' fall in love with people\nHold the person that you love closely if they're next to you\nThe one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you\nAppreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond\n\u2018Cause you never really know what you got until it's gone"

Guess what I saw?\nA fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth\nI was so in shock, my heart went down south\nSo please, listen to the message that I send\nDon't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."
